<p class="center">An AR app deployed to Ipad commissioned for the
    BMBF-Innovationsforum "Zivile Sicherheit" 2022. </p>
<p>
    This project was made during my time at <a href="https://relative.berlin" target="_blank">relative.berlin</a>
    as the lead developer of the project.
    The assets were mostly produced in-house, and I wrote all of the code and put everything together.

        <p>Deployed to Ipad, this project helped me getting more familiar with the whole IOS environment. Xcode,
            Testflight, as the lead developer on the project, I learned the whole pipeline from concepting to pushing to
            the app store.</p>

        <p>Under the supervision of the client, iterating and integrating feedback was a key part of the
            project.</p>
        <p>A million thanks to the people at Relative for trusting me with that opportunity!</p>
