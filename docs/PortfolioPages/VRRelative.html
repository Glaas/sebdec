        This project was made during my time at <a href="https://relative.berlin" target="_blank">relative.berlin</a>
        as the lead developer of the project.
        The assets were mostly produced in-house, and I wrote all of the code and put everything together.
    </p>
    <p>
        The project was made in Unity, and was deployed to the HTC Vive Pro, the Valve Index and the Oculus Quest 2.

            The project features a complex indoors environment the player navigates using a waypoint system indicating
            them
            where to go next.</p>
        <p>Developed over a period of 4 weeks, the experience showcases multiple technological innovations developed by
            the client company, to show it in action to investors.</p>

            <p>The project had some challenges, such as tackling UI (both in world-space and in a HUD style), physics,
                player navigation, implementing voice-over, all within an unknown framework.</p>
            <p>Under the supervision of the client, iterating and integrating feedback was a key part of the
                project.</p>
            <p>A million thanks to the people at Relative for trusting me with that opportunity!</p>
