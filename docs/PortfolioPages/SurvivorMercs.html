SURVIVOR MERCS is a roguelite bullet-heaven, inspired by Rogue Legacy, Vampire Survivors, and others. It's a
systems-heavy project with a lot of moving parts, and I'm responsible for the gameplay programming, technical design,
and CI/CD with Unity Cloud Build and Steam.
<br />
Main tasks involve:
<ul>
    <li>Tool development (Visual editor for enemy waves, testing framework, custom attributes and drawers, custom gizmos
        and visualisation tools...)</li>
    <li>CD/CI pipeline using Unity Cloud Build and Steamworks, using git hooks to create different builds suiting our
        current needs</li>
    <li>Backend work like implementation of Steam, Twitch and Switch SDKs, achievements, build automation, etc.</li>
    <li>Gameplay implementation (enemy waves, enemy & ally behaviour, pathfinding, map generation...)</li>
    <li>Appointed "the guy to talk to if you have a merge conflict"</li>
</ul>

Survivor Mercs already had a public demo which managed to gather the attention of thousands of players, and will soon
hit Early Access on Steam.

        <h3>
            You are the Commander of your Merc squad!
        </h3>
        Exterminate hordes of enemy troops and mighty bosses with thousands of unique weapon and skill combinations.
        Start each Operation with a unique Commander generated from quirky, random Traits. Figure our your best
        tactic to create the most broken, OP squad as you capture one Objective after another to call in new Mercs
        and level-up your Gear on procedurally generated maps.

        <h3>
            Grab all the Loot!
        </h3>

        Then choose to face the Boss or find the Extraction Point. By extracting and saving your Commander & Mercs
        you get temporary bonuses for your next run. And the next one, until you inevitably fall in battle!
        Spend your Loot on upgrades & new stuff!
        Build up your bunker HQ to recruit new Mercs, buy more Gear, open up additional Maps & Operations and
        research powerful, permanent upgrades. And save up for that Clone Bay to frankenstein your own Commanders.

        <h3>
            No run is the same!
        </h3>
        Test your skills in this wacky blend of auto-shooting and twin-stick shooter. Perfectly time your active
        abilities, test your aim with an armed Commander or control the horde and support your squad with tactical
        Traits. Find the best Gear and Merc combinations to max-out your killing potential - every time again!
