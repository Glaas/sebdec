<div class="center">As most mid-90s kids, I grew up with the Playstation 1, and the trend we've been seeing in low-poly
    and low-res content convinced me to finally try my hand at it.</div>

        <p>Making that game was a fantastic opportunity to experiment with finding ways to force Unity not to apply the
            modern graphical upgrades we expect from game engines. Who wants to make an anti-aliasing system in [year
            you're in when reading this]?</p>

            I will definitely experiment more with PS1-style graphics. That project was such a blast to work on, and
            it's very forgiving when every tedious step (looking at you, UV mapping) is not always done with a level of
            quality you would expect in production.
