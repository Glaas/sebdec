<p>When working with scenes loadded additivily in Unity, it can be frustrating and tedious to load them individually,
    especially when iterating on levels.
    I was working on a <a href="2b">2d platformer</a> consisting of many short scenes, which was a good use case for a
    custom tool.

<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Simple to set-up</strong>
        Just drag-and-drop the level loader into your scene.
    </li>
</ul>
