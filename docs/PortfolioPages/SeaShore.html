    <p>This project is in active development. I acquired a Quest II and the goal of this project is to experiment with
        VR programming as a pet project.</p>
    <p>The experience is centered on your companion, a small and friendly bird, and have friendly interactions with it.

        <p>Throw a frisbee and your companion will fetch it for you.</p>
        <p>The bird will always grab it and bring it back.</p>

        <p>Using URP, the game is developed within the OpenXR framework, allowing it to be deployed to any headset.</p>
        <p>However, the main is the Quest II, so I can gather feedback more easily by carrying my headset around with me.</p>
