    <p>This project is in active development. I acquired a Quest II and the goal of this project is to experiment with
        VR programming as a pet project. The experience is centered on your companion, a small and friendly bird, and
        have friendly interactions with it.
        The game has an <a href="https://glaas.itch.io/seashore">itch.io page</a>, but a build will only be uploaded when the features for the 0.1.0
        will be implemented.</p>
    <p><strong>Important:</strong> the environment meshes were generated in <a
            href="https://www.townscapergame.com">Townscaper</a>, a city procedural generator. (Please go buy it!)</p>

        <p>Throw a frisbee and your companion will fetch it for you.</p>
        <p>The bird will always grab it and bring it back.</p>

        <p>Using URP, the game is developed within the OpenXR framework, allowing it to be deployed to any headset.</p>
        <p>However, the main is the Quest II, so I can gather feedback more easily by carrying my headset around with
            me.</p>
