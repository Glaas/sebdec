Sepak-Easy is a dialogue system for Unity built with ease of use as a primary goal.
When I got started in Unity, I was frustrated that although you can find third-party dialogue systems, they were packed
with features making them appealing for commercial use, but making them way harder to get into.
This system is simple to set-up, and great for more small-scale projects.
