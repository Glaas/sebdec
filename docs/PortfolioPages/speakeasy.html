        <p>This is a minimalistic dialogue system for Unity. It's a simple way to create a dialogue system that can be
            used in a game. It's not a full-featured dialogue system, but it's a good starting point for a game.</p>
        <p> Speak-Easy is a dialogue system for Unity built with ease of use as a primary goal.
            When I got started in Unity, I was frustrated that although you can find third-party dialogue systems, they
            were packed
            with features making them appealing for commercial use, but making them way harder to get into.
            This system is simple to set-up, and great for more small-scale projects.</p>

        <p>The <code>Dialogue Container</code> component is the angular stone of the system, and contains all the logic
            and data necessary to each entity.</p>
        <p>The dialogue can be either directly serialized in the inspector, for easy and fast prototyping, or stored as
            Scriptable Objects.</p>
