<p>
    Sepak-Easy is a dialogue system for Unity built with ease of use as a primary goal.
    When I got started in Unity, I was frustrated that although you can find third-party dialogue systems, they were
    packed
    with features making them appealing for commercial use, but making them way harder to get into.
    This system is simple to set-up, and great for more small-scale projects.</p>

<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Simple to set-up</strong>
        <br>
        Just drag-and-drop the dialogue system into your scene.
