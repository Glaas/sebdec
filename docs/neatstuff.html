                <li>A <a href="https://seebass22.itch.io/desktop-bird">cute bird for your desktop</a>, that will just
                    mind his business. He's also the protagonist of one of my games !</li>

        </div>
        <li>A <a href="https://github.com/Glaas/SebEssentials">collection of tools</a> and hands-on component to
            use in your Unity projects. Controllers, extra maths classes, todo list tool, and more. (Forgive the
            name.)</li>
        <li>A <a href="https://glaas.github.io/DnD-Fortune-Cookie/">fortune cookie generator</a> that is
            Dungeons and Dragons oriented, to have a glimpse at the fate of your characters before your game
            session !</li>
        <li>I am also a blacksmith, with a degree and everything! I studied at <a
                href="https://www.orientation.com/etablissements/lycee-des-metiers-dart-georges-guynemer-12681">Georges
                Guynemer school</a>. I am still very in love with it, and I will take the opportunity to make more
            knives anytime! You can find some samples of my work <a
                href="https://www.portfoliobox.net/admin/#/forge">here.</a></li>
        <li>This one's unfinished. It was supposed to be a parody website based on <a href="https://is2020over.com">Rami
                Ismail's</a> idea. He agreed to let me do it, but I've never
            got around to finish it. You can still find it <a href="https://is2021better.com">here</a>.</li>
