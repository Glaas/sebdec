<h3>Have a look !</h3>
<ul class="alt">
    <li>A <a href="https://seebass22.itch.io/desktop-bird">cute bird for your desktop</a>, that will just
        mind his business. He's also the protagonist of one of my games !</li>
    <li>A <a href="https://github.com/Glaas/SebEssentials">collection of tools</a> and hands-on component to
        use in your Unity projects. Controllers, extra maths classes, todo list tool, and more. (Forgive the
        name.)</li>
    <li>A <a href="https://glaas.github.io/DnD-Fortune-Cookie/">fortune cookie generator</a> that is
        Dungeons and Dragons oriented, to have a glimpse at the fate of your characters before your game
        session !</li>
    <li>This one's unfinished. It was supposed to be a parody website based on <a href="https://is2020over.com">Rami
        Ismail's</a> idea. He agreed to let me do it, but I've never
        got around to finish it. You can still find it <a href="https://is2021better.com">here</a>.</li>
